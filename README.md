## Postulates

1. ### It is the API who Defines **Guided-Flow** steps.

   It is important to define responsibilities here.

   - Back-end is responsible for offering **Guided-Flows** according to current users rights, access group, login status etc.
   - Front-end code is clueless about the business logic - it only collects data.
   - Front-end communicates with the api upon each step's data submission.
   - Guided-Flow steps contain clear instructions: what and how should be collected.
   - Front-end does not perform any api queries in between the **Guided-Flow** steps.

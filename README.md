# Guided-Flow üßë‚Äçü¶Ø

This repository is a basic setup to test **Guided-Flow** paradigm.  
Bring up discussion, test real-life scenarions, find hidden stones.

## Postulates

### It is important to define responsibilities here.

- Back-end is responsible for offering **Guided-Flows** according to current users rights, access group, login status etc.
- Front-end code is clueless about the business logic - it only collects data.
- Front-end communicates with the api upon each step's data submission.
- Front-end does not perform any api queries in between the **Guided-Flow** steps.
- Guided-Flow steps contain clear instructions: what and how should be collected.

## Start project

```
# install all node_modules
cd front && npm i && cd ../api && npm i

# Start client
cd front
npm start

# Start backend
cd api
npm start
```

## You may wonder

- How does a stateless API keep data generated by in between the steps?

```
The data generated by the API in between the steps travels back and forth betwen API and client. Thus eliminating the need for cache.
```
